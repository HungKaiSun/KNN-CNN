# KNN-CNN
A python implementation of K-nearest neighbors and condensed K-nearest neighbors.

The Feature and Observation classes can be used in ML applications for classification/regression outside of this particular algorithm.
Data sets must first be converted to a list of Observation objects, and can then be passed into the algorithms. There is also a five-fold cross-validation setup that can be used. An example of calling the scripts on example data can be seen in the main.py file.
